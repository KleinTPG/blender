# Blender Basics

[BLENDER BASICS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3BcVxaRgVY&list=PL3GeP3YLZn5hhfaGRSmRia0OwPPMfJu0V)

An introductory course focusing on basic control of the program. Recommended to take as a first step into blender. A bit dry because nothing is actually modeled but all of the information is super useful and makes any subsequent tutorials much easier in my opinion.
